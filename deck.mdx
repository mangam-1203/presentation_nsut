# What does it do

Clorify is a ML based application that provides people suffering from color-blindness the capability to drive flawlessly on roads using machine learning based object detection and tint shifting using image processing. Moreover,it helps the users to detect colors in general life to identify objects.

---

# Necessity
1. Helping color blind people to drive
2. Easily recognising the colors of similar shades
3. Test the severity level of color vision deficiency  
4. An economic solution to color blindness

# Our idea behind this
1. Using Ishihara test identify the person's condition and the level of color-blindness.
2. Provide a virtual assistant for them.     
3. That will notify them about the obstacles ahead beforehand.
4. We have integrated text to speech in our App.

---

5. Our object recoginzation device will detect the objects like traffic lights,cars,other vehicles etc.
6. The real magic happens with our algorithm to determine the colour of objects.
7. We have also integrated tint shifts in our device to help them recognize and differentiate between colours in daily life activities.
   This will be responsive to their colour blindness type.
8. Speech recognization is also enabled to further enhance the user-experience

# Advantages
1. Solves our problem set to perfection.
2. Nearly negligible cost keeping in mind the problem set it's targetting and the solution it's providing
3. Very convenient to use.infact couldn't ask for anything more in terms  of it.
