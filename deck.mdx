# What does it do

Clorify is an ML based application that provides people suffering from color blindness the capability to drive flawlessly on roads using machine learning based object detection and tint shifting using image processing.Moreover,it helps the users to detect colors in general life to identify objects.

# Problem set
1. Colour blind people are not getting driving license.
2. That hinders their growth and development.
3. They feel discriminated from rest of the crowd.
4. They feel a sense of loneliness and depression as no on is there to guide them.

# What we thought?
1. Provide a virtual assistance for them.
2. That will notify them about the obstacles ahead beforehand.
3. We have integrated text to speech in our rob.
4. Our object recoginzation device will detect the objects like traffic lights,cars,other vehicles etc.
5. The real magic happens with our algorithm to determine the colour of objects.
6. We have also integrated tint shifts in our device to help them recognize and differentiate between colours in daily life activities.
   This will be responsive to their colour blindness type.
7. Speech to text (editable)

# Advantages
1. Solves our problem to perfection.
2. Nearly negligible cost keeping in mind the problem set it's targetting and the solution it's providing
3. Very convenient to use.infact couldn't ask for anything more in terms  of it.
